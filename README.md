# React Portfolio Templat

A customizable **React** application designed as a template for creating personal portfolio websites. This project uses Create React App as its foundation, making it easy to develop, test, and build a production-ready site to showcase your work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Have the latest version of **Node.js** installed.
- Ensure **npm** is functioning correctly.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies using:
   npm install package-lock.json

### Running the Project
To start the development server, run:
npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site. The page will automatically reload as you make changes, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

### npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
More info: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### npm run build
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. It optimizes the React code for the best performance and includes hashed filenames for cache-busting.
